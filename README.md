# Music Supervillain
Our project for the 2017 Moog Hackathon at Georgia Tech.

## What is it?
Music Supervillain is a wearable instrument consisting of a pair of gloves. The user operates it by touching his/her thumbs to any of the twelve digits on each hand. The non-dominant hand is designated as the "control" hand. The dominant hand is designated as the "playing" hand.

The control hand can be used to do things like change instruments, change scales, conduct looping operations, and change the playing mode. The playing hand plays notes depending on the current playing mode.
